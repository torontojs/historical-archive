🙌 TorontoJS Tech Talks [ Online ] is back again!
We're thrilled to announce the return of TorontoJS Tech Talks to the virtual stage!
The practice of building software every day involves making decisions, large and small. Every bug, incident, and feature raises questions of how to best solution for speed to market while maintaining quality and security. Besides banging out code, the work of software building requires getting buy-in on the approach and presenting risks or tradeoffs that can be uncomfortable and controversial.
In this talk, Jen Chan recounts challenges and learnings from trying (and sometimes failing) to do “the right thing” on highly ambitious and challenging software projects.
Bio:Jen Chan is a software developer who spent the last 8 years barreling through 3 startups, 2 agencies, 1 well-known public company. She lives in Toronto with a cat.
