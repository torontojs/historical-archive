Be nice!</strong> <a href=\"https://torontojs.com/code_of_conduct\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read the code of conduct online.</a></li>\n<li><strong>Please make sure to be respectful to staff and tip well!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Firkin isn't charging TorontoJS a booking fee for the PubScript series of socials or other social events.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>We're thrilled to have a free venue for regular social events and want to keep a positive relationship with the Firkin!</strong></li>\n<li>We have members, volunteers, and future guests who use mobility aids (walking canes, wheelchairs, and service dogs) - including ones organizing our social events.</li>\n<li><strong>Under no circumstances should anyone ever touch a mobility aid (e.g. mobility cane, crutches, or wheelchair) or distract a service dog!</strong> Treat mobility aids as extensions of a person - even when the person isn't currently using their mobility aid. If you need a mobility aid moved, ask the person it belongs to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">### <strong>Transit:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pl-5 list-disc mb-4\">\n<li>TTC: Right near Queen TTC Station, and on the Yonge bus line</li>\n<li>GO Transit: Two stops north of Union Station on the Yonge subway line</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">### <strong>Cycling:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pl-5 list-disc mb-4\">\n<li>Close to the Richmond and Adelaide east/west cycle tracks</li>\n<li>There's Bike Share Toronto docking stations nearby. The closest is on Richmond Street at Yonge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">### <strong>Driving:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pl-5 list-disc mb-4\">\n<li>Check with Green P for public parking lots. With the Firkin on Yonge being in the heart of downtown Toronto there's parking, but it's much easier to take transit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">## <strong>Accessibility Notes:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">### <strong>Venue</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Firkin is wheelchair accessible with level access, elevator to the second floor and to the washrooms in the basement. Washrooms are accessible with accessible stalls in each gendered washroom. The Firkin hosts events by A11yTO, so the staff handles disability accommodation requests professionally and respectfully.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">### <strong>Transit</strong></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The closest accessible station is usually Queen Station, but due to water damage the northbound platform station is not accessible until July, 2024. If you are arriving from Union or if you are going home north bound you will need an alternate route.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The closest accessible TTC routes are:</p>\n<ol class=\"pl-5 list-decimal mb-4\">\n<li>Yonge bus north to Dundas Station or Wellesley Station</li>\n<li>St. Andrew Station, then the King Street streetcar east to Yonge Street. Walk or roll north three blocks. The streetcar tracks on the east side of Queen are filled in so it's an easy wheel over them (no front casters getting stuck)!</li>\n<li>Union, then the Bay bus north. Catch the bus at the SE corner of Bay and Front Streets. Get off at Queen and Bay. Walk or roll east one block. (Note there is construction so it's quite a tight sidewalk with bumps.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">WheelTrans can drop off on Yonge. The Firkin entrance is right near the stairway TTC entrance on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If you need accessibility accommodations, please reply to this form: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/FqQf6w8csEJjehiF7\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://forms.gle/FqQf6w8csEJjehiF7</a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">***Please contact the organizers if you have any accessibility questions or concerns.***</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Alt text for cover image:<br>\nSquare graphic.
