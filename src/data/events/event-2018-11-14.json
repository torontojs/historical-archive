This is a place for intermediate and advanced JavaScript developers to learn new skills, experiment with interesting technologies and have tons of fun.\n\nThis month's meetup is happening on a WEDNESDAY, unlike most workshops so make sure you add the event to your calendar!\n\nWe'll be building an optical illusion called a penrose triangle in ThreeJS this month. All the coding will happen online through a site called codepen, so you just need to make sure you have a working browser! As a backup, it would be wise to also download the library at [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/)  \nSee [https://github.com/zachgoldstein/penroseTriangle](https://github.com/zachgoldstein/penroseTriangle) for a bit more information.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n*   A laptop with a web dev environment, including an editor and a local server\n    \n*   Some proficiency in JavaScript\n    \n*   A cheerful and inquisitive attitude\n    \n*   An appetite (for knowledge and for pizza -- thanks to New Relic for sponsoring us!)\n    \n\nThe speakers codes on the projector, and everyone in the room copies that code into their own laptops. You'll go home with an exciting new program, and if there's time left over at the end you'll do something cool with it and show a demo to everyone. Fun!\n\nTimetable:\n\n6:30 - doors open, eat pizza\n\n7:00 - workshop code-along\n\n8:30 - extend the codebase\n\n9:00 - everyone goes home"
