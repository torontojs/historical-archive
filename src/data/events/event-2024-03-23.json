This event welcomes all, so come and contribute your ideas! üöÄ\n\nAdditionally, feel free to bring your projects to work on in other rooms. TorontoJS Code Club provides a welcoming coding environment where you can freely brainstorm ideas, seek advice, and tackle software challenges together. üí°\n\nWhether you have a specific project in mind or simply want to join the discussion, this event is for you. It's a fantastic opportunity to collaborate on beginner-friendly open-source issues, receive feedback on and work on personal projects, address bugs, implement new features, or enhance your codebase, explore Leetcode-style interview questions for those in job search, and experiment with and share insights on new JS libraries. üõ†Ô∏è\n\nAbove all, join us for the sheer joy of building! Please note, a code of conduct is enforced at all TorontoJS events. ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nPlease RSVP on Guild: [https://guild.host/events/code-club-rfcs-and-proposals-t8wcgr](https://guild.host/events/code-club-rfcs-and-proposals-t8wcgr)"
