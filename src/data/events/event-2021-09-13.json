With a special, hybrid JS Tech-Talk followed by our classic JS Social!\n\nThere are times where displaying \"where\" in your site or application makes sense. In all those cases, there is a bucket load of tools you can easily reach for. For 15 minutes, Brian will take you on a tour of the tools you can use, and where they shine for your particular use cases.\n\nSpeaker Bio:  \nBrian Bancroft has been a software developer since 2016, and works in the applied spaces somewhere in the middle of JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. Currently, he is a consultant with Sparkgeo, and specializes in helping tech companies work with geospatial problems on the web. He currently lives somewhere on the edge of Canada. But you can still reach him at [https://sparkgeo.com](https://sparkgeo.com), or at his twitter handle, @brian\\_bancroft where he complains about thorny plants.\n\nThis talk is open to all skill levels.\n\nCode of conduct is enforced at all TorontoJS events [https://torontojs.com/p/code\\_of\\_conduct](https://torontojs.com/p/code_of_conduct)\n\nTimetable:\n\n6:30 - doors \"open\", Intro\n\n6:45 - Talk Starts\n\n7:15 - Q&A with the Speaker\n\n7:30 - End : Socializing and networking."
