Some issues don't require much context to solve and are suitable for beginners too. This group programming event can be a great opportunity to start your open-source journey.\n\nAre you job searching? We can take a look at Leetcode-style interview questions together.\n\nCountless new libraries appear in the JS ecosystem every year. We can try out a new piece of tech together and share our first impressions.\n\nThis event is not about competition or achievements. Come for the pure joy of building.\n\nThe event will be held on the TorontoJS [discord](https://discord.gg/EfVDg9prGf?event=1205954886861066300).\n\nThe [TorontoJS Code of Conduct](https://torontojs.com/code_of_conduct) is enforced at all TorontoJS events.\n\nFind out more information about events @ [Guild](https://guild.host/torontojs/events)"
