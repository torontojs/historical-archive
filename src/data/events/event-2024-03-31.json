We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and flexibility.\n\nInstead of the usual Code Buddy Club session, it will be an hour where we'll be chilling and talking about random stuff, essentially a fun one-hour social time with fellow developers.\n\nI hope everyone has a wonderful and lovely long weekend. See you all soon!\n\n\\## What is a Code Buddy Club\n\n*   It's similar to a book club but uses free courses and tutorials instead of books\n*   Participants are free to code independently, or to pair program.\n*   Meet on discord to share progress, provide support, and help with debugging\n*   Each course should take roughly 1 - 8 weeks to complete\n*   It's a really relaxed, supportive, and social atmosphere.\n\n\\## 2024 Courses List and Schedule\n\n\\### Regular meetings\n\n*   Sundays 11am-12pm\n*   Tuesdays 6:30pm-7:30pm\n*   Location: TorontoJS Discord on the Code Buddy Channel [https://discord.com/channels/1078763949132107926/1183920018799472784](https://discord.com/channels/1078763949132107926/1183920018799472784)\n*   \\*\\* Contact us on Slack if you need a Discord Invite!
