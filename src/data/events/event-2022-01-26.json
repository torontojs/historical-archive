Your Favourite Event (maybe, I dunno, I'm partial to it)\n\nFriends + Code = LOVE!\n\nTorontoJS Social is our lightest event where like minds get together, have a snack or drink, and talk javascript/coding. Feel free to bring your laptop, but there is no specific programming/talk portion to the event.\n\nWe'll be at the Watson's for the last Wednesday of the month! Come talk JavaScript, Development, and Community!\n\nThis event is open to all skill levels.  \nCode of conduct is enforced at all TorontoJS events [https://torontojs.com/p/code\\_of\\_conduct](https://torontojs.com/p/code_of_conduct)"
