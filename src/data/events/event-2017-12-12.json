This is a place for intermediate and advanced JavaScript developers to learn new skills, experiment with interesting technologies and have tons of fun.\n\nThis month we've got Alex Wilmer on the mic, turning your computer into a super sampler!\n\nDid you know your browser is a drum machine, just waiting for you to sprinkle in some code to make a sick beat? Or a soundboard to add flatulence to your favorite podcast guests? Or a game of pong that quotes Trump everytime you're _winning_? Well c'mon down to the TorontoJS workshop to turn a simple webpage into a sound-didily-sampler of the 21st century!\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n*   A laptop with a web dev environment, including an editor and a local server\n    \n*   Some proficiency in JavaScript\n    \n*   A cheerful and inquisitive attitude\n    \n*   An appetite (for knowledge and for pizza -- thanks to New Relic for sponsoring us!)\n    \n\nThe evening revolves around two main pieces: the code-along and the group work. The first hour has the speaker coding on the projector, while the attendees copy that code into their own laptops. During the second hour we'll break into groups to extend that common code in new and exciting ways.\n\nTimetable:\n\n6:30 - doors open, eat pizza\n\n7:00 - workshop code-along\n\n8:00 - break for ideas and more pizza\n\n8:15 - extend the codebase in groups\n\n9:15 - demo round\n\n9:30 - everyone goes home"
