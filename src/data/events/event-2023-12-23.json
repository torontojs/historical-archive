  "details": "Details\n-------\n\n\"It's the most wonderful time of the year\" and \"All I want for Christmas is a JS project\"!\n\nCome and join us for the last Code Club of the year. Feel free to bring your eggnog and cheerful spirit!\n\nTorontoJS Code Club is a friendly coding environment where we can bounce ideas & ask questions freely while working on software challenges together.\n\nPlease bring your projects/ideas to the event, or just show up and contribute to the discussion!\n\n*   We can tackle an open-source issue together. Some issues don't require much context to solve and are suitable for beginners too. This group programming event can be a great opportunity to start your open-source journey.\n*   We can hack on personal projects together. Is there a bug in your software that you want to fix with the group? Is there a feature you want to add? How about some refactoring to clean up your codebase? It's fun to see how everyone has different approaches to solve these technical challenges.\n*   Are you job searching? We can take a look at Leetcode-style interview questions together.\n*   Countless new libraries appear in the JS ecosystem every year. We can try out a new piece of tech together and share our first impressions.\n\nThis event is not about competition or achievements. Come for the pure joy of building.\n\nThe event will be held on the [TorontoJS Discord server](https://discord.gg/UkwS8hg45K?event=1149041295071911956).  \nThe [TorontoJS Code of Conduct](https://torontojs.com/p/code_of_conduct) is enforced at all TorontoJS events.  \nFind out more about events \\[[Guild.io](http://Guild.io)\\]([https://guild.host/torontojs/events](https://guild.host/torontojs/events))"
