  "details": "Details\n-------\n\nDon't stare directly into the solar eclipse! Instead, stare at your monitor while you attend April's Code Club event! TorontoJS Code Club is a friendly coding environment where we can bounce ideas & ask questions freely while working on software challenges together. Please bring your projects/ideas to the event, or just show up and contribute to the discussion!\n\n*   We can tackle an open-source issue together. Some issues don't require much context to solve and are suitable for beginners too. This group programming event can be a great opportunity to start your open-source journey. üöÄ\n    \n*   We can hack on personal projects together. Is there a bug in your software that you want to fix with the group? Is there a feature you want to add? How about some refactoring to clean up your codebase? It's fun to see how everyone has different approaches to solve these technical challenges. üñ•Ô∏è\n    \n*   Are you job searching? We can take a look at Leetcode-style interview questions together. üëè\n    \n*   Countless new libraries appear in the JS ecosystem every year. We can try out a new piece of tech together and share our first impressions. üëÄ\n    \n\nThis event is not about competition or achievements. Come for the pure joy of building.\n\nOur [Code of Conduct](https://torontojs.com/code_of_conduct) is enforced at all TorontoJS events."
