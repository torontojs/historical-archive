Instead, stare at your monitor while you attend April's Code Club event! TorontoJS Code Club is a friendly coding environment where we can bounce ideas &amp; ask questions freely while working on software challenges together. Please bring your projects/ideas to the event, or just show up and contribute to the discussion!</p>\n<ul class=\"pl-5 list-disc mb-4\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">We can tackle an open-source issue together. Some issues don't require much context to solve and are suitable for beginners too. This group programming event can be a great opportunity to start your open-source journey. üöÄ</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">We can hack on personal projects together. Is there a bug in your software that you want to fix with the group? Is there a feature you want to add? How about some refactoring to clean up your codebase? It's fun to see how everyone has different approaches to solve these technical challenges. üñ•Ô∏è</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Are you job searching? We can take a look at Leetcode-style interview questions together. üëè</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Countless new libraries appear in the JS ecosystem every year. We can try out a new piece of tech together and share our first impressions. üëÄ</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This event is not about competition or achievements. Come for the pure joy of building.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Our <a href=\"https://torontojs.com/code_of_conduct\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Code of Conduct</a> is enforced at all TorontoJS events.</p></div>",
