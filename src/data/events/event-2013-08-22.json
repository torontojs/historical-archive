This month we have two talks which cover both front-end and server-side JavaScript.\n\n[Marionette.js](http://Marionette.js) - Matt Briggs\n\nIn a day and age where frameworks like Ember and Angular exist, why would somebody still write a JavaScript application using Backbone?\n\nIn this talk, Matt will show how MarionetteJS eliminates boilerplate, encourages modular design, and makes working with Backbone views an overall more pleasant experience.\n\nVert.x on JavaScript - Tasveer Singh\n\nHave you ever wanted to build a WebSocket powered application? How about one that's built on a solid messaging foundation? Tasveer will show you what he loves about Vert.x including its non-blocking evented architecture, its simple & scalable concurrency model, communicating with a browser, and the ease of testing a Vert.x application.\n\nTalk Proposals and Sponsoring\n\nIf you would like to give a talk or would like to sponsor an event, please contact Tasveer at [taz@torontojs.com.](http://taz@torontojs.com.)\n\nSee you there!"
