This is a place for intermediate and advanced JavaScript developers to learn new skills, experiment with interesting technologies and have tons of fun.\n\nInterested in writing more tests with testing-library and Jest for your React projects, but not sure where to start? This workshop will dive into some testing theory, how to select DOM elements with testing-library, and how to write mocks for your unit and integration tests.\n\nAbout\n\nNicole Chung is a Staff Software Engineer at CircleCI on the frontplane team. Previously, she led a workshop for Toronto JS on Abstract Syntax Trees [https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/events/266239985](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/events/266239985)\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n*   A laptop with a web dev environment, including an editor and a local server\n*   Some proficiency in JavaScript\n*   A cheerful and inquisitive attitude\n*   Hunger for knowledge\n\nThe speakers codes on the projector, and everyone in the room copies that code into their own laptops. You'll leave with an exciting new program, and if there's time left over at the end you'll do something cool with it and show a demo to everyone. Fun!\n\nTimetable:\n\n6:30 - doors open, chit chat\n\n7:00 - workshop code-along\n\n8:30 - Q&A or extended chit chat\n\n9:00 - End"
