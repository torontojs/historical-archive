This month, we're focusing on the React ecosystem and tools that have sprung out of it.\n\nWe'd like to thank [Rangle.io](http://Rangle.io) for sponsoring the event:  \n[Rangle.io](http://Rangle.io) ([http://rangle.io/](http://rangle.io/)) is the leading JavaScript and Lean UX firm dedicated to helping startups and enterprises move to the modern web. Our front-end teams use AngularJS, React, Ionic, ReactNative and a continuous delivery process to get our clients to the right market with the right software at the right time.\n\n6:00pm - Doors Open. Grab a bite to eat and a drink while networking with other attendees.\n\n6:30pm - Opening Announcements. News and information about TorontoJS and upcoming community events.\n\n6:40pm - Routing like it's 1999 - Tasveer Singh ([https://twitter.com/tazsingh](https://twitter.com/tazsingh))  \nA long time ago, software developers simply put files in folders that were structured based on the routing structure of their application. The web server would traverse this structure based on the requested URL.\n\nSince then, the rise of web APIs have made it imperative to have a separate routing table to determine where the request is sent.\n\nHowever in modern times where that complexity can stay on the server, is it possible to re-approach routing on the front-end?\n\nTaz will be talking about this possibility, what it enables for your team's development workflow, and his tool that makes this a reality: [https://github.com/tazsingh/pegasus-loader](https://github.com/tazsingh/pegasus-loader)\n\nAbout Tasveer  \nTaz is a software architect, CTO of HoodQ, and organizer of Toronto JavaScript. He recently released a React+Flux Toolkit called [Griffin.js](http://Griffin.js) which has been powering HoodQ’s products for the past 1.5 years. When he’s not tinkering with a computer, he can be found with his car at the local race track or rock climbing gym.\n\n7:20pm - Better Functional Architecture with Redux - Yuri Takhteyev ([https://twitter.com/qaramazov](https://twitter.com/qaramazov))  \nA lot of developers have come to appreciate the benefits of Flux architecture, which makes it a lot easier to deal with complex application state in a large front end application. Redux is a new framework that takes Flux to a new level - or, one could say, to its logical conclusion. With Redux makes it easy to write most of your code as pure functions, which vastly simplifies testing. It also helps you eliminate a lot of asynchronous logic. Redux only concerns itself with managing state, so it can be combined with the most popular view-layer frameworks, such as React and Angular.\n\nAbout Yuri  \nYuri Takhteyev is the CTO of [Rangle.io](http://Rangle.io), a JavaScript consultancy based in Toronto.\n\n8:00pm - Fireside Q&A chat with the speakers and special guest  \nWe're going to try something new since we're focusing on the React ecosystem. If you have any questions for the speakers based on their talks or generally about React, this is your opportunity to ask it! This is an informal discussion and audience participation is very welcome.\n\nWe're thrilled to additionally invite a special guest, Robin Vierich, to join us for the fireside chat.\n\nAbout Robin  \nRobin is a mobile game developer at Uken Games. He designed the Flux-based frontend for Uken's newest game, and works daily with JavaScript, React, and PIXI. He's especially interested in mobile web performance and optimizations.\n\nNote that the schedule is subject to change and accommodates 10-15 minute breaks between sessions.\n\nInterested in speaking or sponsoring?  \nPlease email us at [team@torontojs.com](http://team@torontojs.com) for more information. All skill levels are welcome for talks!\n\nJoin us on Slack ([http://slack.torontojs.com](http://slack.torontojs.com))  \nFollow us on Twitter ([http://twitter.com/torontojs](http://twitter.com/torontojs))\n\nSee you there!"
