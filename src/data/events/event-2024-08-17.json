Some issues don't require much context to solve and are suitable for beginners too. This group programming event can be a great opportunity to start your open-source journey.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">We can hack on personal projects together. Is there a bug in your software that you want to fix with the group? Is there a feature you want to add? How about some refactoring to clean up your codebase? It's fun to see how everyone has different approaches to solve these technical challenges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Are you job searching? We can take a look at Leetcode-style interview questions together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Countless new libraries appear in the JS ecosystem every year. We can try out a new piece of tech together and share our first impressions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This event is not about competition or achievements. Come for the pure joy of building. Everyone is welcome!</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Platform</strong><br>\nThe event will be hosted on the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/8JxSMjrPJv\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TorontoJS discord server,</a> on the #js-code-club channel.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Accessibility Accommodations</strong><br>\nThis is an online event on Discord, please feel free to contact us at [<a href=\"http://events@torontojs.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">events@torontojs.com</a>](<a href=\"http://mailto:events@torontojs.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">mailto:events@torontojs.com</a>) if you need any accommodations for the event.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Our <a href=\"https://torontojs.com/code_of_conduct\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Code of Conduct</a> is enforced at all TorontoJS events.</p></div>",
