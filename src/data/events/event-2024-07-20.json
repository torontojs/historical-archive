  "details": "Details\n-------\n\nIt is not a [Scandinavian horror film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772262/), but we hope the event will be thrilling!  \nJoin us for a cool two hours of mob programming where we can work on all kinds of code, even though it is not [The Purge](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2184339/)! (The TorontoJS Code of Conduct still applies)\n\n**About Code Club**\n\nTorontoJS Code Club is a friendly coding environment where we can bounce ideas & ask questions freely while working on software challenges together.  \nPlease bring your projects/ideas to the event, or just show up and contribute to the discussion!\n\n*   We can tackle an open-source issue together. Some issues don't require much context to solve and are suitable for beginners too. This group programming event can be a great opportunity to start your open-source journey.\n*   We can hack on personal projects together. Is there a bug in your software that you want to fix with the group? Is there a feature you want to add? How about some refactoring to clean up your codebase? It's fun to see how everyone has different approaches to solve these technical challenges.\n*   Are you job searching? We can take a look at Leetcode-style interview questions together.\n*   Countless new libraries appear in the JS ecosystem every year. We can try out a new piece of tech together and share our first impressions.\n\nThis event is not about competition or achievements. Come for the pure joy of building. Everyone is welcome!\n\n**Platform**\n\nThe event will be hosted on the [TorontoJS discord server](https://discord.com/invite/8JxSMjrPJv), on the #js-code-club channel.\n\n**Accessibility Accommodations**\n\nThis is an online event on Discord, please feel free to contact us at \\[[events@torontojs.com](http://events@torontojs.com)\\]([mailto:events@torontojs.com](http://mailto:events@torontojs.com)) if you need any accommodations for the event.  \nOur [Code of Conduct](https://torontojs.com/code_of_conduct) is enforced at all TorontoJS events."
