This will be a really fun evening working on cutting-edge technology.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\nWe're building a decentralized publishing platform!\n\nCome join us on March 25 at 6:30pm at Bento Miso as we come together to create a new generation of web forum. One that's decentralized, open source, multi-threaded, easy to use, and fun to navigate. Written entirely in HTML5/JavaScript and running on the browser, it will take advantage of the latest advances in p2p js, encryption, and blockchain technologies.\n\nEveryone who participates will be well fed with sushi and pizza, have their choice of caffeinated beverages, get t-shirts, loot bags, and be entered to win prizes."
