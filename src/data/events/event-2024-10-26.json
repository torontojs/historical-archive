Some issues don't require much context to solve and are suitable for beginners too. This group programming event can be a great opportunity to start your open-source journey.</li>\n<li>We can hack on personal projects together. Is there a bug in your software that you want to fix with the group? Is there a feature you want to add? How about some refactoring to clean up your codebase? It's fun to see how everyone has different approaches to solve these technical challenges.</li>\n<li>Are you job searching? We can take a look at Leetcode-style interview questions together.</li>\n<li>Countless new libraries appear in the JS ecosystem every year. We can try out a new piece of tech together and share our first impressions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This event is not about competition or achievements. Come for the pure joy of building.
