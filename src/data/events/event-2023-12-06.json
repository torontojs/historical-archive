He'll be demoing an open-source app he is working on that uses the techniques. And he'll explain why and when you might want to do this.\n\n**7:05 pm** - **Share Code Between React and React Native**  \n**Emily Xiong** is a front-end developer who likes hiking, biking, and running. I am going to do a full marathon next year. I am currently working for an open-source company called Nx. I previously worked for enterprises and consulting firms in Toronto.\n\nEmily will explain why usually creating web and mobile apps requires totally different tech stacks, and it is pretty hard to share code. This presentation shows how she adds a React web app and a React Native mobile app, and how she optimizes codeshare between the two.\n\n**7:35 pm** - 15 mins break  \n**7:50 pm** - **Apollo caching and how to befriend it**  \n**Raman Lally** is a software developer with a passion for solving complex problems, mastering technology, and applying himself in everything that he does. His experience includes large-scale React projects with GraphQL servers and microservices. He's involved in all aspects of the stack, from GraphQL servers to React components. Currently, he's pioneering a GraphQL solution at his organization.\n\nHe will give us an inside look at how the cache works in Apollo client and what it is doing behind the scenes (normalization, automatic updates, and garbage collection).\n\n**8:20 pm** - Networking  \n**9:00 pm** - Doors Close\n\nNote: All times in the schedule are an approximation.\n\n**Many thanks to [Super.com](http://Super.com) for hosting us!**  \nWe're looking for sponsors for for events like these.
