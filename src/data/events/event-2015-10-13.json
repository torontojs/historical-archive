See you there!\n\nThis month we're thrilled to have an advanced workshop from Marcos Caceres on service workers! If you're interested you'll need to sign up now, because there's only eight spots left! Find his comment below describing the workshop and add your reply to it in order to sign up.\n\nHack nights are a time to slough off your workaday shackles and stretch the limits of what you can do in javascript. It's a chance to experiment with new tools and techniques, learn new paradigms and practices, commiserate and collaborate with fellow devs and make interesting things.\n\nWe work in small, self-assembled groups and we'll share our results at the end of the night.\n\nIt's important to have project ideas ahead of time, so please do the following:\n\n1.  subscribe to js weekly ([http://javascriptweekly.com/](http://javascriptweekly.com/))\n    \n2.  pick something interesting\n    \n3.  post a comment about it here\n    \n\nExamples of interesting projects:\n\n*   try a framework: noflo, meteor, ~todomvc, etc\n    \n*   try a library: q, [allong.es](http://allong.es), bilby, lemonad, etc\n    \n*   try a language: fay, elm, roy, clojurescript, flapjax, etc\n    \n*   try some web apis: audio, webgl, svg, webrtc, etc\n    \n*   go parallel: workers, river trail, webcl, etc\n    \n\nWe are beginner friendly. Here's some resources for getting up to speed with javascript:\n\nEloquent JS ([http://eloquentjavascript.net/](http://eloquentjavascript.net/))\n\nEffective JS ([http://effectivejs.com/](http://effectivejs.com/))\n\nJS Allonge ([https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge))\n\nFun JS ([http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do))\n\nAnother great way to learn JS is by reading the source of good libraries -- [underscore.js](http://underscore.js) ([http://underscorejs.org/](http://underscorejs.org/)) is a solid starting point."
