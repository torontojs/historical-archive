This is a place for intermediate and advanced JavaScript developers to learn new skills, experiment with interesting technologies and have tons of fun.\n\nWe would like to thank RBC Ventures for sponsoring food and beverages for the event. [www.rbcventures.ca](http://www.rbcventures.ca)\n\nThis month our own TorontoJS Organizer, Matthew Mihok, will demystify production environments, Operations, and DevOps:\n\n\"Typically when building a web application the main focus is not on how it will get accessed by your customers. Often small teams or a person may resort to leveraging tools like Heroku, Firebase, or serverless solutions because operations is confusing and scary. Let's build tooling to deploy to a server and explore what that actually looks like.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you'll begin to see how servers and databases come together in a production environment, and demystify DevOps and Operations work.\"\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n*   A laptop with a web dev environment, including an editor and a local server\n    \n*   Some proficiency in JavaScript\n    \n*   OPTIONAL: DigitalOcean has graciously offered $100 credit for folks who signup with the following link: [https://do.co/torontojs2018devops](https://do.co/torontojs2018devops) to provide servers to use. (Otherwise if you do not wish to sign up with them we'll have a shared server for everyone to use)\n    \n*   A cheerful and inquisitive attitude\n    \n*   An appetite (for knowledge and for pizza -- thanks to RBC Ventures for sponsoring us!)\n    \n\nThe speakers codes on the projector, and everyone in the room copies that code into their own laptops. You'll go home with an exciting new program, and if there's time left over at the end you'll do something cool with it and show a demo to everyone. Fun!\n\nTimetable:\n\n6:30 - doors open, eat pizza\n\n7:00 - workshop code-along\n\n8:30 - extend the codebase\n\n9:00 - everyone goes home"
