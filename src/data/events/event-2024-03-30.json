He has been a Software Engineer, Presales Architect, and Professional Services Consultant and now works in Developer Advocacy. John considers himself a full-stack engineer, having written everything from operating systems to training courses and every level in-between. Nowadays, John, a maker at heart, builds hardware and software blending MongoDB with other technologies from tiny microcontrollers to infinitely scalable cloud services to solve problems - MongoDB pays him to write and talk about them. He lives in the Scottish countryside with three Labradors, four squirrels, and various robots.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">ðŸš€ <strong>Agenda:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pl-5 list-disc mb-4\">\n<li>3:00 PM - Introduction &amp; welcome notes from TorontoJS</li>\n<li>3:10 PM - John Page's Tech Talk on MongoDB</li>\n<li>3:40 PM - Q&amp;A Session and/or Mob Programming</li>\n<li>4:00 PM - Networking</li>\n<li>4:20 PM - Closing Remarks</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">ðŸ“§ <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href=\"http://organizers@torontojs.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">organizers@torontojs.com</a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Elevate your tech journey with us!
