Talks are open to all skill levels, but these particular talks may be suited to intermediate and staff levels.  \nCome out to **VMWare Tanzu Labs** for some juicy talks on developer experience!\n\n[Code of Conduct](https://torontojs.com/p/code_of_conduct) is enforced at all TorontoJS events and spaces-online or in-person.\n\nVenue is 2 min walk from King/Yonge\n\nGendered toilets and a single occupancy accessible toilet are available.  \nPlease do not leave trash around.

Shruti introduces us to the POUR Framework (Percievable, Operable, Understandable and Robust) to make development more intuitive when looking at code, design specs, assets and testing features. She'll also touch on how tools can be used to make this easier: browser extensions, colour contrast checkers, screen readers and integrations for your CI/CD pipeline.\n\n**Nik LeBlanc**, \"DORA at DevCycle: Tracking engineering metrics that matter\"\n\nGoogle's DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) research shows that the most reliable software teams typically optimize their software for four metrics, including Change Lead Time, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate and Mean Time To Recovery. Nik will share insights from DORA, SPACE, and DevEx that set high performing teams apart from low performing teams.\n\n**Rob Jackiewicz**, \"Fast iteration cycles, how to get feedback and build the right thing\"\n\n**Speaker Bios**\n\n**Shruti Vellank**i is a Software Engineer who loves working on the front end, Design Systems, Component Libraries, and Accessibility. She enjoys reading nonfiction and is part of the Toronto Public Library's Culture and Technology Bookclub!
