They all mimic features we already have, natively, in JavaScript. Variables, Functions, Inheritance, Modularity and a whole lot more are all solved problems. Let's change how we think about approaching creating our styles and utilize the power of the most ubiquitous language already within our projects. You'll learn just how easy and powerful it it is to write JavaScript to generates CSS. We'll also dive into some reasons why PostCSS and Inline styles are missing the mark in terms of “The Future of CSS” as well as a number of real-world demos and uses cases.\n\nAbout Darcy  \nDarcy is a Full-stack Developer, Designer, Speaker, Entrepreneur, Mentor & Advocate who has been focused on creating amazing User Experiences, promoting web standards/best practices and developing useful tools for the design and development communities across the Mobile, Tablet and Desktop landscapes.
