When we have enough of them, we go off and code our solution and everyone’s happy when we present at the demo. At least, that’s what we hope…\n\nDomain-Driven Design is a design technique that spans the technical and organizational. We will cover the organizational aspects of Domain-Driven Design in this talk. If time permits, we'll show an example of domain driven modelling that connects to CQRS and event sourcing.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nBtara Truhandarien is a Backend Engineer at Faire.
