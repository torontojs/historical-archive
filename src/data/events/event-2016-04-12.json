Here, I'll let him tell you about it:\n\nXavier will be giving a workshop on writing fragment shaders in GLSL, running in the browser via WebGL. If you've used to build visuals before, shaders are a completely different programming paradigm, and allow you to get a very different set of effects.. We'll use the great GLSL editor from the book of shaders here: [http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/) . That book ([http://thebookofshaders.com](http://thebookofshaders.com) ([http://thebookofshaders.com/](http://thebookofshaders.com/))) is also a great resource if you want to start playing around now.\n\nOkay, back to me. The JS Workshop is a place for intermediate and advanced JavaScript developers to learn new skills, experiment with interesting technologies and have tons of fun.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n*   A laptop with a web dev environment, including an editor and a local server\n    \n*   Some proficiency in JavaScript\n    \n*   A cheerful and inquisitive attitude\n    \n*   An appetite (for knowledge and for pizza -- thanks to New Relic for sponsoring us!)\n    \n\nTimetable:\n\n6:30 - doors open, eat pizza\n\n7:00 - workshop starts\n\n8:00 - break for ideas and more pizza\n\n8:15 - start building things\n\n9:15 - demo round\n\n9:30 - everyone goes home"
