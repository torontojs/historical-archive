Your Favourite Event (maybe, I dunno, I'm partial to it)\n\nAlcohol + Code = LOVE!\n\nBeerScript is our lightest event where like minds get together, have a pint, and talk javascript/coding. Feel free to bring your laptop, but there is no specific programming/talk portion to the event.\n\nWe'll be at the Watson's for the last Wednesday of the month! Come talk JavaScript, Development, and Alcohol!"
