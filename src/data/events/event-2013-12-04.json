Hosted by many leaders of the communities as a thank you for all those that participated in the past year.\n\nTickets are $10 in advance, and will be $15 at the door (cash only at the door). All proceeds from the event will be going to the Daily Bread Food Bank through #HoHoTO as a collaborative gesture.\n\nCome join us at The Courthouse for drinks, music, and all around celebrations! We’ll be giving those that supported the communities a little time halfway through the night to give recognition and thanks for being outstanding. This includes those that sponsored groups, held events, helped by providing venue space and more.\n\nRemember to invite your colleagues out and / or show off that you’re coming out by sharing the link to the event using the hashtag #TOTechWrap.\n\nCheck out the event page and buy tickets on Uniiverse!
