Taras Mankovski - Composable state management with Microstates\n\nState management should easy. Itâ€™s difficult because complexity grows exponentially when you add state. In this presentation I will show how Microstates decreases complexity in state management by making state composable. Taras Mankovski is a Software Engineer at The Frontside and co-creator of Microstates [https://twitter.com/tarasm](https://twitter.com/tarasm)\n\n2.  Lightning talk: Tomek Maszkowski - Spreadsheet-like programming in JS with xcell\n\nProgramming calculations like insurance tariff or mortgage plan imperatively is a tedious and error-prone process. Their maintenance is even harder. Spreadsheets feel much better suited for it. This presentation will demonstrate how to use xcell for programming any kind of calculations declaratively - much like as we do them in spreadsheets. Tomek Maszkowski is an independent freelance full stack developer. [https://twitter.com/tomazy](https://twitter.com/tomazy)\n\n3.  Fireside Q&A chat with special guests Shane Keulen, Alex Wilmer, along side speaker Taras Mankoviski. Moderated by Dann Toliver.
