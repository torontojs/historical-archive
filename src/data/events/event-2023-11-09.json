His career also includes stints as a startup founder and a fractional CTO for various companies. His diverse experiences give him a unique perspective on the intersection of technology and business.\n\n**7:30pm** - **Weird Graphs** Graphs are everywhere: in our interfaces, databases, editors, queries and more. Let's look at a few and see what stories they tell us.\n\n**Dann Toliver** enjoys building things, like data structures, distributed systems, programming languages, communities of smart friendly humans, and robot pony castles with his kids.\n\n**8:00pm** - **Wait you're using React Native on the Web?!** Taz dives into the skepticism of building React Native Apps for the Web, including everything from design systems and navigation to ExpoGL and Reanimated, from how they‚Äôve successfully built Guild on top of this architecture.\n\n**Taz Singh** is the Founder of Guild and long time participant in communities around the world. He has over two decades of software experience ranging from video games & robotic AI to consumer application development, has served as a principal technical management consultant, and is a serial startup founder. When he's not behind his computer, he can be found chasing his cat around the house or being chased by cars around a race track.\n\n**8:30pm** - **Third-Party JavaScript Special Discussion** Join us with Ben Vinegar, the author of the book on \"Third-Party JavaScript\", and Taz Singh for a special discussion on the topic.
