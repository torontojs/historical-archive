Your Favourite Event (maybe, I dunno, I'm partial to it)\n\nFriends + Code = LOVE!\n\nTorontoJS Social is our lightest event where like minds get together, have a snack or drink, and talk javascript/coding. Feel free to bring your laptop, but there is no specific programming/talk portion to the event.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 threat, we'll be hosting remotely via Zoom! Come talk JavaScript, Development, and Community!"
