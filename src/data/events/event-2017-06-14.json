Even expert developers are left wandering around in the twisty passages of webpack without a clear roadmap, and the proper mental models for using React efficiently are not easy to come by.\n\nJoin us for an evening of enlightenment, with a pair of workshops designed to lift you out of the quagmire and set your feet on solid ground.\n\nWebpack 2 with Rohan Nair\n\nIn this workshop we will learn the basics of setting up Webpack 2 for a React project for development and for deployment to production. We will cover Hot Module Reloading, bundles, and optimizing builds.  \nRohan is currently the Head of Engineering at Pungle Payments, a Fintech startup using React, Redux, Elixir and Docker. He wrote the Webpack React HMR guide, and often forgets that he did.\n\nReact State with Kalpana Arivazhagan\n\nIntroduction to Reactâ€™s state. Talk about the differences between Component state and Application State; know when and when not to use them.\n\nKalpana is a Full Stack Software Engineer interested in learning new technologies and building proof of concepts to keep herself up-to-date. For the past few years, she has been doing front-end development using AngularJs; most recently with React.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:00 Doors open, eat food, talk to nice people  \n6:30 Welcome message and announcements  \n6:40 Webpack workshop  \n7:40 Break, talk to more nice people  \n8:00 React workshop  \n9:00 Continue talking to nice people somewhere else"
