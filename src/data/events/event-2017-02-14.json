This is a place for intermediate and advanced JavaScript developers to learn new skills, experiment with interesting technologies and have tons of fun.\n\nThis month we have Adrian Li presenting on Reason! Here's the description:\n\nSince React was inspired by OCaml, Facebook has created a new interface to OCaml called Reason. Join us for a quick introduction to the Reason syntax and the possibilities of building frontends with this exciting new technology.\n\nMake sure you follow the instructions here to install the repo ahead of time: [https://github.com/adrianmcli/rehydrate-workshop](https://github.com/adrianmcli/rehydrate-workshop)\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n*   A laptop with a web dev environment, including an editor and a local server\n    \n*   Some proficiency in JavaScript\n    \n*   A cheerful and inquisitive attitude\n    \n\nThe evening revolves around two main pieces: the code-along and the group work. The first hour has the speaker coding on the projector, while the attendees copy that code into their own laptops. During the second hour we'll break into groups to extend that common code in new and exciting ways.\n\nTimetable:\n\n6:30 - doors open, eat pizza\n\n7:00 - workshop code-along\n\n8:00 - break for ideas and more pizza\n\n8:15 - extend the codebase in groups\n\n9:15 - demo round\n\n9:30 - everyone goes home"
