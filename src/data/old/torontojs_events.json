Be nice! Read the code of conduct online.\nPlease make sure to be respectful to staff and tip well!\nThe Firkin isn't charging TorontoJS a booking fee for the PubScript series of socials or other social events.\nWe're thrilled to have a free venue for regular social events and want to keep a positive relationship with the Firkin!\nWe have members, volunteers, and future guests who use mobility aids (walking canes, wheelchairs, and service dogs) - including ones organizing our social events.\nUnder no circumstances should anyone ever touch a mobility aid (e.g. mobility cane, crutches, or wheelchair) or distract a service dog! Treat mobility aids as extensions of a person - even when the person isn't currently using their mobility aid. If you need a mobility aid moved, ask the person it belongs to.\n\n### Transit:\n\nTTC: Right near Queen TTC Station, and on the Yonge bus line\nGO Transit: Two stops north of Union Station on the Yonge subway line\n\n### Cycling:\n\nClose to the Richmond and Adelaide east/west cycle tracks\nThere's Bike Share Toronto docking stations nearby. The closest is on Richmond Street at Yonge.\n\n### Driving:\n\nCheck with Green P for public parking lots. With the Firkin on Yonge being in the heart of downtown Toronto there's parking, but it's much easier to take transit.\n\n## Accessibility Notes:\n### Venue\nThe Firkin is wheelchair accessible with level access, elevator to the second floor and to the washrooms in the basement. Washrooms are accessible with accessible stalls in each gendered washroom. The Firkin hosts events by A11yTO, so the staff handles disability accommodation requests professionally and respectfully.\n### Transit\nQueen Station is wheelchair accessible. The accessible exit from the nothbound platform is just a half block south from The Firkin. Go straight ahead when you exit at the street. The door is pointing in the correct direction (north/right).\nWheelTrans can drop off on Yonge. The Firkin entrance is right near the stairway TTC entrance on the sidewalk.\nIf you need accessibility accommodations, please reply to this form: https://forms.gle/FqQf6w8csEJjehiF7\n***Please contact the organizers if you have any accessibility questions or concerns.***\nAlt text for cover image:\nSquare graphic.
